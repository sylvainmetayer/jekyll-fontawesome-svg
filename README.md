Use all of [FontAwesome Icons](http://fontawesome.com/) without the need to import the full css / svg.

This Jekyll plugin will look for the icon you include in your page and only include the icons you used.

## Usage

- When you want to include an icon, you can use the same name as you will do to with FontAwesome

    `{% fa_svg fab.fa-twitter %}`

    or

    `{% fa_svg 'fab.fa-twitter' %}`

    Use the `fa_svg` liquid tag, with the type of the icon you want to use (`fab`, `fas` or `far`), a dot (**important**) and the icon name. 

    Each icon get the `icon` class, which you can use in your CSS to customize the appearance of your icon.

- You will need to have in **one** part of your project (at the end of your layout for example) liquid tag to generate the SVG definition.

    The syntax is this one `{% fa_svg_generate %}`
